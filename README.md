# Web application exposing the Pagila sample database

This project is used to try out JPA/Hibernate using a non-trivial database.

See [sample Pagila DB](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila/tree/master) for initializing the database using Docker.
Make sure to start the PostgreSQL Docker container before starting the application.

The Pagila database was derived from the Sakila sample database.
See [sample Sakila DB](https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila) for the Sakila database,
as provided by Lukas Eder of [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) fame. There we can find
an ER-diagram, which to a large extent explains the Pagila database as well.
